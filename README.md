# We. Are. FEASTIEboys.
Have you ever wondered what you could whip up in the kitchen based off of what is in your pantry? 
FEASTIEboys has wondered too and came up with a solution so you do not have to!

We are passionate about food and the Beastie boys.
It is highly recommended that you listen to the Beastie boys when navigating through the app, however, such bliss is not a requirememnt. 



## User Stories
As a user, I would love to minimize food waste by using what I already have on hand. Sometimes I'm cooking the same recipes and end up ordering take out because I am bored of the same dishes. The app, FEASTIEboys, offers me suggesstions by generating a random dish that I can make. If I am feeling adventurous and would love to try a new dish, I could use the app to generate a completely random dish to try. Who knows? I'm one click away from discovering a new cuisine. 

As a user who loves cooking, I aleady have a lot of recipes I already love. Sometimes I forget about them until a friend or family member requests for it. I can input my recipes in the recipe book so theres never any guessing for what I have made, what goes in it, and how its made.
